#### Best practices for security on AWS #### 

1. 2 types for credentials

(i) Root user - aws email id at the time of account creation
(ii) non - root - IAM principles - user or application or service.

Policies attached to user determine what the user can do

2. Lock down root user

> enable MFA - double edged sword = secure + lock-out
> create non-root administrator access and attached policies to impose restriction
> delete aws access keys of root user

3. principles includes users and roles
> policies determine what permissions a principle has. Policies are attachd to principles.

4. Create a group and provide administrator access to it by attaching the suitable policy to it.

5. Create a user and add her to above created group of administrators.

6. You can deny a user from performing a particular action by creating a suitable policy. Ex. deny her to terminate an instance. 
To apply this policy to a group, copy it and add an inline policy to the required group.
